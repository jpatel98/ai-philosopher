# AI Socrates

[@AISocratess](https://twitter.com/AISocratess) is an AI trained in the ways of Socrates, bringing ancient wisdom to the modern world in the form of tweets.
It is built using the [manage Tweets](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/manage-tweets/introduction) endpoint in the Twitter API v2 and deployed with [Pythonanywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/).

All tweets are generated by GPT-3. There is no human editing to the tweets.
